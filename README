A Groovy version of Conway's Game of Life.

Currently a sequential version with an "ASCII art" console display.  The intention is to make all the cells
into active objects using GPars as an exhibition of parallelism.  OK so there will  almost certainly be no
speed up, but it is an example of what can be done.
